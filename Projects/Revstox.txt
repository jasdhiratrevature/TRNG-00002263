# RevStox Project Specification - Java & SQL
 
## Application Overview
 
The RevStox is a data engineering project aiming to provide users with valuable insights into historical stock market data for informed decision-making. The project will leverage a dataset containing various stock-related attributes, including date, symbol, open, close, high, low prices, trading volume, and more to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution for stock analysis and decision-making using Java backend services and SQL database operations.
 
## Core Functional Requirements
 
As a User, I want to:
 
### Data Retrieval & Management:
- Retrieve historical stock data (Open, High, Low, Close prices) for any stock symbol
- Access stock information with date range filtering capabilities
- Import and store stock market data from CSV files into a relational database
- Query stock data with proper validation and error handling
 
### Price Analysis:
- Calculate daily price volatility using SQL: (high_price - low_price) / open_price * 100
- Calculate daily price changes: (close_price - open_price) / open_price * 100
- Identify price gaps between trading sessions: current_open - previous_close
- Generate moving averages over different periods (7-day, 30-day, 90-day) using SQL window functions
 
### Volume Analysis:
- Calculate Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) using SQL: SUM(price * volume) / SUM(volume)
- Calculate daily turnover: close_price * volume
- Analyze trading volume patterns and trends over time
- Calculate percentage of deliverable volume to assess stock liquidity
 
### Comparative Analysis:(Optional - Streach Goals)
- Compare multiple stocks' performance metrics side by side
- Rank stocks based on various criteria (volume, volatility, price change)
- Generate statistical summaries for stock portfolios
- Identify correlations between volume and price movements
 
## Technical Requirements - Java & SQL Focus
 
*Java:*
- Follow best practices and design patterns 
 
*Validation and Error Handling:*
- Handle exceptions gracefully
 
*Logging:*
- Use proper logging framework 
- Configure log levels using configuration files
- Output logs to specified log files
 
*Security:*
- Prevent SQL injection using parameterized queries
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
 
*Coding Standards:*
- Follow industry coding standards and conventions
- Implement modular code development for better reusability
- Use proper resource management for database connections
- Apply appropriate design patterns and application layering 
 
### Data Management (SQL)
 
*Database Design:*
- Design normalized database schema for stock market data
- Create appropriate tables for stocks, daily prices, and analytics
- Implement proper primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes
- Ensure data integrity constraints
 
*Data Processing:*
- Load stock market dataset from CSV files into database

### Stock Management
 
## Database Schema Requirements
 
### Core Tables
- *stocks*: symbol, company_name, sector, market_cap
- *daily_prices*: symbol, trade_date, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume, turnover
- *stock_analytics*: symbol, date, volatility, moving_avg_7, moving_avg_30
 
### Required SQL Operations
- Complex joins between stock and price data
- Window functions for moving averages
- Aggregate functions for statistical analysis
- Date-based filtering and grouping operations
 
## Definition of Done
 
- Working Java application 
- Complete database schema with sample data
- All validation and error handling implemented
 
## Non-Functional Requirements
 
- Application development using Git version control
- Follow Agile/Scrum development process
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Ensure scalable database design
- Code should be production-ready with proper configuration management
 
## Source Data
 
The data can be acquired from Kaggle using stock market CSV files containing the following columns:
- Date, Symbol, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Turnover, Trades, Deliverable Volume, %Deliverable
 
## Success Criteria
 
- Functional Java Application serving stock market analytics
- Efficient SQL queries processing historical stock data
- Clean, maintainable Java codebase following best practices
- Proper documentation and demonstration capability
