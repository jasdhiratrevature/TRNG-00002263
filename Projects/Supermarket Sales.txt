Supermarket sales analysis project specification - using Java and SQL
## Application Overview
The RevMarketSales is a Supermarket Sales Analysis system using Java and SQL to provide actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The system will leverage a relational database to store and manage sales data and a Java application to process, analyze, and visualize the information. 

## Objectives
- To identify top-performing branches, cities, and product lines based on sales and profitability.
- To understand customer purchasing patterns by type, gender, and payment method.
- To analyze sales trends over time, including seasonal variations and peak shopping hours.
- To evaluate customer satisfaction based on transaction ratings.
- To provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational efficiency. 
 
## Functional requirements
- Ability to import sales data from CSV files into the database.
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Gross Income, and Average Rating.
- Analyze sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
- Compare sales performance across different branches, cities, and product lines.
- Analyze customer purchasing patterns based on customer type, gender, and payment method.
- Determine the profitability of various product categories and sub-categories.
- Evaluate the impact of discounts on sales and profit margins.
- Identify peak sales hours and days of the week.

## Technical Requirements - Java & SQL Focus

- Apply appropriate design patterns and application layering 
 
### Data Management (SQL)
 
*Database Design:*
- Design normalized database schema for supermarket sales data
- Implement proper primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes
- Ensure data integrity constraints
 
*Data Processing:*
- Load supermarket sales data dataset from CSV files into database

9. Deliverables
Project source code and documentation.
Database schema and SQL scripts.
Compiled Java application or web deployment package.
Sample reports and visualizations generated by the system. 

## Definition of Done
 
- Working Java application 
- Complete database schema with sample data
- All validation and error handling implemented
 
## Non-Functional Requirements
 
- Application development using Git version control
- Follow Agile/Scrum development process
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Ensure scalable database design
- Code should be production-ready with proper configuration management
 
## Data Source
The project will utilize a historical supermarket sales dataset for analysis. 
Example Dataset: A publicly available dataset from platforms like Kaggle or GitHub can be used, which typically includes attributes such as:
Invoice ID , Branch, City, Customer Type (e.g., Member, Normal), Gender, Product Line (e.g., Food & Beverages, Sports & Travel), Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, Total Sales, Date and Time of Transaction, Payment Method, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin Percentage, Gross Income, Product Rating

## Success Criteria
 
- Functional Java Application 
- Efficient SQL queries processing historical data
- Clean, maintainable Java codebase following best practices
- Proper documentation and demonstration capability
